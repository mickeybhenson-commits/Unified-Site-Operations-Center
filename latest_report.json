Ice and\nsnow covered roadways will become treacherous and impassable.\nWidespread power outages are likely due to the weight of the ice\nand snow on tree limbs and power lines. The outages could last for\ndays in some areas. The hazardous conditions could impact the\nMonday morning commute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Highest snow and sleet accumulations are\npossible north of I-40. Highest ice accumulations are possible\nacross the southern mountains of North Carolina, the mountains of\nnortheast Georgia, and the mountains of South Carolina.",
